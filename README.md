# weekend-sql-to-do-list (7/29)

[Project Instructions](./INSTRUCTIONS.md), this line may be removed once you have updated the README.md

## Description

The task for this project is to create a to-do application that where tasks can be uploaded, retrieved, marked complete, and deleted. The task application interacts with a database (using sql) where the data is stored.

This is my first CRUD (create, read, update, delete) project! I am proud of my fast progress in Prime Digital Academy's full-stack engineering program while creating this app. Technologies used include HTML5, CSS, jQuery, Node.js, AJAX, Express, pg, SQL, PostgreSQL, POSTICO, and Bootstrap.
