## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

The task for this project is to create a to-do application that where tasks can be uploaded, marked complete, and deleted. The task application interacts with a database (using sql) where the data is stored.

This is my first CRUD (create, read, update, delete) project! I am proud of my fast progress in Prime Digital Academy's full-stack engineering program while creating this app. Technologies used include HTML5, CSS, jQuery, Node.js, AJAX, Express, pg, SQL, PostgreSQL, POSTICO, and Bootstrap.
